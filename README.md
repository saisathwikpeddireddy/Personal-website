# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site that I created to showcase my skills, projects and experience. Still a work in progress but I'll keep updating it!

## What I Used

Built this with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Some JavaScript for animations
- Bootstrap for the dark theme (makes everything look better!)

## Cool Features

- Works on mobile and desktop (responsive design)
- Dark theme that's easier on the eyes
- Animations when scrolling 
- Simple navigation
- All my resume info in one place

## Pages I made

- **Home**: About me, my education and skills
- **Experience**: My work history 
- **Projects**: Stuff I worked on 
- **Contact**: How to reach me

## How to view

Just download and:
1. Open index.html in any browser
2. Or put it on a web server if you want to host it

## TO DO:
- Maybe add a blog section later???
- Fix form validation on contact page
- Add more animations

## File List
